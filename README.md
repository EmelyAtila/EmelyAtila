## Hello, I'm Emely Atila.

**`FullStack Developer`**

I am a developer with experience in Computer Engineering concepts and practices. I studied Systems Analysis and Development in 2019 at UNIP, and in 2023 I ventured to study Engineering in another country, where I was able to deepen my skills in the field of technology.
Currently, I dedicate my time to advanced knowledge in areas such as Calculus, Physics, and hardware and software fundamentals.
I have experience in developing and integrating solutions using technologies such as Java, Python, Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, applying good programming and architecture practices.
I am focused on software development with an emphasis on scientific research, task optimization, and innovation.
